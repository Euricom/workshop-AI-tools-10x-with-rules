# Prisma Usage

We use SQLite.

This is how we import db (prisma instance) in the project:

```typescript
import { db } from "@/server/db";
```

The prisma file is located at: `prisma/schema.prisma`.

## Seeds

When asked, add seed files in `prisma/seeds` folder

```code
prisma/seeds/
├── users.ts
├── products.ts
```

Add seed to prisma config in package.json

```json
"prisma": {
  "seed": "tsx prisma/seeds/users.ts && tsx prisma/seeds/products.ts"
},
```

Add a script to run the seed when not available

```json
"scripts": {
  "db:seed": "prisma db seed",
}
```
